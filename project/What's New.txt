V1.03

BugFixes:

   - Removed some mistakenly-included early development code that caused keys
     1, 2, 3, and 4 to modify the editor's level layout size settings without
     correcting the level data array, causing accidental data loss upon accidental
     stray keypresses. The proper keys for resizing the level are (and have been)
     Ctrl+Arrows

V1.02

   - Update to the Sonic 1 Object Def files by Hivebrain (graphics for GHZ and various
     misc sprites, object def text and settings tweaks)

BugFixes:

   - Though the previous version properly accounted for the "Remember Sprite State"
     flag, it was still handled improperly during save. The flag saves now, and a
     feature to set all sprites in the level to their default "Remember Sprite State"
     setting (SHIFT+0) can be used to correct improper flag states (but not otherwise
     damaged sprites). (This is not automatic because it would contradict the ability
     to manually toggle the flag for each sprite)

   - Minimum/maximum sprite setting values weren't properly enforced when using the
     A/Z keys, allowing the value to go below 0 or above FF, causing the program to
     read beyond the end of the object def data and crash. The limit is now properly
     enforced

V1.01

BugFixes:

   - Misinformation about sprite storage in Sonic 1 led to a misuse of a flag
     stored in the sprite type, causing some sprites to vanish during gameplay.
     This flag is now recognized as the "Remember Sprite State" flag and handled
     appropriately (This problem wasn't present in SonED because the original
     object def files treated the full value as if it were the real ID)

   - A typo caused Height map lists smaller than 256 entries would only expand to
     255. The final entry is now available

   - A typo in the Sonic 2 Object Def rendered the "Egg Prison" sprite unselectable.
     The problem is corrected in the current def, enabling the sprite to be selected
     for editing and/or moving

V1.00

   - First release
